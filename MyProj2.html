    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        Twext takes a user's location and phone number to personalize their communication 
        experience. By signing up for Twext, the user automatically registers for natural 
        disaster and safety updates. Meaning, in case of an emergency, the user will be 
        provided a description of what is happening along with a small list of curated tweets 
        relaying information pertaining to this issue. In addition, the user can opt in to sign 
        up for other Twext communication features such as events where the user will get 
        information and the top Tweets regarding an event of their choice. Seema worked mainly with
        the Twilio and Tweepy API to help curate certain tweets, and send the user text 
        notifications.
