    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        Seema has been working on various projects, both frontend and backend website development, 
        using React.js and Bootstrap. She also wrote API tests to collect errors from website 
        to send to Mongo DB, to further improve user experience. During the summer, she participated in 
        the summer internship where she focused on developing terminal visual to receive 
        real-time updates from remote LED sign using RPCs. She also recently used Docker 
        in order to containerize individual microservices.
