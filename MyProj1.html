    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      In the summer of 2020, IBM hosted Good Tech Scholar's Program teaching students IBM cloud
      basics along with other fundamental cloud technologies. After a 2 week training period,
      students were asked to create a product utilizing the IBM cloud to solve the issue of
      educational inequality. Seema and her team, utilized the IBM Cloud APIs like Text-to-Speech
      as well as React.js and Node.js in order to create a full-scale project that helped
      students with disabilites learn in an online environment. Seema specifically worked
      on the homepage, creating a mock login and logout page, as well as assiting her teammate
      in creating a matching game. Her team ended up winning first place.
